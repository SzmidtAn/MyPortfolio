                    Almost a year ago I started coding and since then programming has become my biggest interest. Right now I am looking for an internship, and would also like to participate in an exciting project, where I can develop my current knowledge in Android and iOS.

                    I'm studing at the IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Stockholm which feels really fun! In addition, I spend much of my free time creating my first own project - a website similar to the popular platform in several countries www.vinted.com or Marketplace, where the user has the opportunity to sell or buy clothes from others, and a mobile application Just Perfect with the same role.

                    Moreover, I'm educated in media, communication and journalism, which I read at the University in Warsaw. Thanks to that, I have gained a broad knowledge of the new technologies - which I'm really passionate about!</p>
